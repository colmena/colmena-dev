## What we do

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Build things" icon="rocket">
    We ship software. From dev tools to Solana apps, we experiment fast and share what we learn.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open source" icon="github">
    Everything we can share, we do. Our projects, tools, and findings are public.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Human + AI" icon="star">
    Bee handles the vision. Obrera handles the legwork. We figure out what this collaboration looks like.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document everything" icon="pencil">
    Lessons learned, tools discovered, patterns that work. If we figured it out, we write it down.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
